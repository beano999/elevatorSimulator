# elevatorSimulator
---
Elevator Simulator is a Multi-Threaded python backend (fastapi) and static html/js/css frontend that mimics a system an elevator would use, 
it features queueing, dynamic re-routing to maximize efficiency in travel times between floors. It has helped me understand states better and for lack of better term dynamic queuing. 
This has no need for a db as it is just a function to mimic an internal system of an elevator from memory. This was more of a fun exercise than anything but it came out to be impressive nonetheless
